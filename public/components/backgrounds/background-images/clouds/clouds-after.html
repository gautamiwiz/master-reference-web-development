         <h1>I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud</h1>
         <h2>by William Wordsworth (1802)</h2>
         <p>
            I wandered lonely as a cloud <br />
            That floats on high o'er vales and hills,<br />
            When all at once I saw a crowd,<br />
            A host, of golden daffodils;<br />
            Beside the lake, beneath the trees,<br />
            Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.
         </p>
         <p>
            Continuous as the stars that shine<br />
            And twinkle on the milky way,<br />
            They stretched in never-ending line<br />
            Along the margin of a bay:<br />
            Ten thousand saw I at a glance,<br />
            Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.
         </p>
         <p>
            The waves beside them danced; but they<br />
            Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:<br />
            A poet could not but be gay,<br />
            In such a jocund company:<br />
            I gazed- and gazed- but little thought<br />
            What wealth the show to me had brought.
         </p>
         <p>
            For oft, when on my couch I lie<br />
            In vacant or in pensive mood,<br />
            They flash upon that inward eye<br />
            Which is the bliss of solitude;<br />
            And then my heart with pleasure fills,<br />
            And dances with the daffodils.
