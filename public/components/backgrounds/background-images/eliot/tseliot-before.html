         <h1>Nobel Prize Acceptance Speech</h1>
         <h2>by T.S. Eliot</h2>
         <p>Poetry is usually considered the most local of all the arts. Painting, sculpture, 
            architecture, music, can be enjoyed by all who see or hear. But language, especially 
            the language of poetry, is a different matter. Poetry, it might seem, separates 
            peoples instead of uniting them.</p>
         <p>But on the other hand we must remember, that while language constitutes a barrier, 
            poetry itself gives us a reason for trying to overcome the barrier. To enjoy poetry 
            belonging to another language, is to enjoy an understanding of the people to whom 
            that language belongs, an understanding we can get in no other way. We may think also 
            of the history of poetry in Europe, and of the great influence that the poetry of one 
            language can exert on another; we must remember the immense debt of every considerable 
            poet to poets of other languages than his own; we may reflect that the poetry of every 
            country and every language would decline and perish, were it not nourished by poetry 
            in foreign tongues.</p>
         <p>When a poet speaks to his own people, the voices of all the poets 
            of other languages who have influenced him are speaking also. And at the same time 
            he himself is speaking to younger poets of other languages, and these poets will 
            convey something of his vision of life and something of the spirit of his people, 
            to their own. Partly through his influence on other poets, partly through 
            translation, which must be also a kind of recreation of his poems by other poets, 
            partly through readers of his language who are not themselves poets, the poet 
            can contribute toward understanding between peoples.</p>
         <p>... And I take the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature ... to be primarily an 
            assertion of the supra-national value of poetry ... and I stand before you, 
            not on my own merits, but as a symbol, for a time, of the significance of poetry.</p>
