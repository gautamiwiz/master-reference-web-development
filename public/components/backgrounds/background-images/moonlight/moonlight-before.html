         <h1>Moonlight</h1>
         <h2>by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (1878)</h2>
         <p>As a pale phantom with a lamp<br />
            Ascends some ruin's haunted stair,<br />
            So glides the moon along the damp<br />
            Mysterious chambers of the air.</p>
            
         <p>Now hidden in cloud, and now revealed,<br />
            As if this phantom, full of pain,<br />
            Were by the crumbling walls concealed,<br />
            And at the windows seen again.</p>

         <p>Until at last, serene and proud<br />
            In all the splendor of her light<br />
            She walks the terraces of cloud,<br />
            Supreme as Empress of the Night.</p>

         <p>I look, but recognize no more<br />
            Objects familiar to my view;<br />
            The very pathway to my door<br />
            Is an enchanted avenue.</p>

         <p>All things are changed. One mass of shade,<br />
            The elm-trees drop their curtains down;<br />
            By palace, park, and colonnade<br />
            I walk as in a foreign town.</p>

         <p>The very ground beneath my feet<br />
            Is clothed with a diviner air;<br />
            White marble paves the silent street<br />
            And glimmers in the empty square.</p>

         <p>Illusion! Underneath there lies<br />
            The common life of every day;<br />
            Only the spirit glorifies<br />
            With its own tints the sober gray.</p>

         <p>In vain we look, in vain uplift<br />
            Our eyes to heaven, if we are blind;<br />
            We see but what we have the gift<br />
            Of seeing; what we bring we find.</p>
