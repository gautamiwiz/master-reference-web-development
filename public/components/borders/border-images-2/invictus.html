      <p>
        Out of the night that covers me,<br />
        Black as the pit from pole to pole,<br />
        I thank whatever gods may be<br />
        For my unconquerable soul.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the fell clutch of circumstance<br />
        I have not winced nor cried aloud.<br />
        Under the bludgeonings of chance<br />
        My head is bloody, but unbowed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beyond this place of wrath and tears<br />
        Looms but the Horror of the shade,<br />
        And yet the menace of the years<br />
        Finds and shall find me unafraid.
      </p>

      <p>
        It matters not how strait the gate,<br />
        How charged with punishments the scroll,<br />
        I am the master of my fate,<br />
        I am the captain of my soul.
      </p>
