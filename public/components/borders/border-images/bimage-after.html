         <h1>On First Looking into Chapman’s Homer</h1>
         <h2>by John Keats</h2>
         <p>Much have I travell’d in the realms of gold,<br />
            And many goodly states and kingdoms seen;<br>
            Round many western islands have I been<br>
            Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold.</p>
         <p>Oft of one wide expanse had I been told<br>
            That deep-browed Homer ruled as his demesne;<br />
            Yet did I never breathe its pure serene<br />
            Till I heard Chapman speak out loud and bold:</p>
         <p>Then felt I like some watcher of the skies<br>
            When a new planet swims into his ken;<br>
            Or like stout Cortez when with eagle eyes<br />
            He star’d at the Pacific — and all his men</p>
         <p>Look’d at each other with a wild surmise —<br>
            Silent, upon a peak in Darien.</p>
