         <h1>Sonnet XXXIII</h1>
         <h2>by William Shakespeare</h2>
         <p>Full many a glorious morning have I seen<br />
            Flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye,<br />
            Kissing with golden face the meadows green,<br />
            Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy;</p>
         <p>Anon permit the basest clouds to ride<br />
            With ugly rack on his celestial face,<br />
            And from the forlorn world his visage hide,<br />
            Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace:</p>
         <p>Even so my sun one early morn did shine,<br />
            With all triumphant splendour on my brow;<br />
            But out, alack, he was but one hour mine,<br />
            The region cloud hath mask'd him from me now.</p>
         <p>Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth;<br />
            Suns of the world may stain when heaven's sun staineth.</p>
