         <h1>I Sing the Body Electric</h1>
         <h2>by Walt Whitman</h2>
         <p>Part 1:</p>
         <p>I sing the body electric,<br /> 
            The armies of those I love engirth me and I engirth them, <br />
            They will not let me off till I go with them, respond to them, <br />
            And discorrupt them, and charge them full with the charge of the soul.</p>

         <p>Was it doubted that those who corrupt their    own bodies conceal themselves? <br />
            And if those who defile the living are as bad as they who defile the dead?<br />
            And if the body does not do fully as much as the soul?<br />
            And if the body were not the soul, what is the soul?</p>
